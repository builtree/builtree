# Governance Policy

This document provides the governance policy for the Organisation. Anyone with an interest in the organisation can join the community, contribute and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the organisation's community.

## 1. Roles.

The organisation include the following roles. Additional roles may be adopted and documented by a project under the organisation.

**1.1. Steering Committee**. The organisation Admins that are responsible for supervising the organisation and taking organisation level decisions. These responsibilities will ensure the smooth running of the organisation and its projects.

**1.5. Contributors**. Contributors are those that have made contributions to a project developed under the organisation.

## 2. Decisions.

**2.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making**. Projects make decisions through consensus of the Maintainers. While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Maintainers will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Contributors and nature of support and objections. The Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.

**2.2. Appeal Process**. Decisions may be appealed by opening an issue and that appeal will be considered by the Maintainers in good faith, who will respond in writing within a reasonable time. If the Maintainers deny the appeal, the appeal my be brought before the Organization Steering Committee, who will also respond in writing in a reasonable time.

## 6. Amendments.
