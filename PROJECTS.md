# Projects

## Builtree Projects

These projects are present directly under the organisation handle. These type of projects can fall under 2 categories:

### 1. Idea Stage Projects

- These are project ideas that have not yet started (as a concrete repo) or are in just the experimentation phase.

- Stays in incubation stage for 1-3 months wherein the idea is initially worked on and is made an official permanent project after the maintainers present the project and progress to the steering committee. Ideas in the incubation can be removed if:

    - They aren’t being worked on by the proposers or anyone from the organization.
    - Disregard of the organization's rules/code of conduct.
    - Report of plagiarism.

- How to submit an idea?

    - Anyone can submit an idea for a project by opening a pull request in the [Builtree/Builtree](https://github.com/builtree/builtree) repository following the [Idea Submission PR template](https://github.com/builtree/builtree/compare/test?expand=1&template=idea_submission.md)!
