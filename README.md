3. Helping contributors by:

    - steering them to projects requiring the skills they have/improve/want to learn.
    - converting ideas to projects and building the right team.
    - introducing them to open-source.

4. Helping projects by:

    - matching them with possible contributors.
    - gain better exposure through an active community.
    - participate in open-source programs.
    - turn projects into products and increasing the future prospects of the project.
